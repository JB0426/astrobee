# // StopNode.srv

The StopNode.srv file defines a ROS service with a single boolean field named success. This boolean field is utilized within the stop_node_service.py code to communicate the success or failure status of the service call. When the service is called, the value of the success field indicates whether the requested action (stopping the interfering node) was successfully executed or not.
